__Hi there__ 👋 I’m Phillip, a PhD student in the Qualcomm-UvA lab (QUVA) at the University of Amsterdam supervised by [Efstratios Gavves](https://www.egavves.com/) and [Taco Cohen](https://tacocohen.wordpress.com/). My research focuses on the intersection of causality and machine learning 🤖, but I am also interested in generative modeling 🌀, reinforcement learning 🕹 and natural language processing 💬. Besides that, I like teaching 👨‍🏫.
A short guide of my main repositories:

### Teaching/Education

- __[uvadlc_notebooks](https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks)__: Jupyter notebook tutorials for the Deep Learning course at UvA. They cover basic deep learning topics such as initialization and optimization, to more complex topics including Normalizing Flows, Vision Transformers and Meta Learning. All notebooks executed can be viewed on our [RTD website](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- __[UvA_summaries](https://github.com/phlippe/UvA_Summaries)__: A collection of summaries that I wrote during my Master studies of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam (2018-2020). Topics cover courses including Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and many more.

### Research

- __[CategoricalNF](https://github.com/phlippe/CategoricalNF)__ (📚[Categorical Normalizing Flows via Continuous Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09790) - *ICLR 2021*): We explore the application of normalizing flows on categorical data and propose a permutation-invariant generative model on graphs, called GraphCNF. On molecule generation, GraphCNF outperforms both one-shot and autoregressive flow-based state-of-the-art of its time.
- __[ENCO](https://github.com/phlippe/ENCO)__ (📚[Efficient Neural Causal Discovery without Acyclicity Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10483) - *CausalUAI workshop 2021, contributed talk*): We scale neural causal structure learning to 1000 variables by replacing constrained optimization with orientation-based parameterization.
- __[meme_challenge](https://github.com/Nithin-Holla/meme_challenge)__ (📚[A Multimodal Framework for the Detection of Hateful Memes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12871) - *NeurIPS 2020 competition track*): UNITER-based architecture for detecting hateful, multi-modal content. Won 4th place of the Hateful Memes Challenge by Facebook.
- __[P2_Net](https://github.com/phlippe/P2_Net)__ (📚[Diversifying Task-Oriented Dialogue Response Generation with Prototype Guided Paraphrasing
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03391) - *preprint 2020*): We develop a synergy of template- and corpus-based dialogue systems for increased diversity and natural conversations.
